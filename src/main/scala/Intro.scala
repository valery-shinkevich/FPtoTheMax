    * Functional programming is all about programming with functions.
    * Functions are:
    *
    * 1. Total. For every input, they return an output.
    * 2. Deterministic. For the same input, they return the same output.
    * 3. Pure. Their only effect is computing value.
    *
    * These properties help us:
    *
    * 1. Reason about our programs using equational reasoning
    * 2. Refactor our programs without changing their meaning
    * 3. Test our programs more easily
    * 4. Invert control so caller always has control over callee
    * 5. Reason about our programs using type-based reasoning
    *
